# Launch the tattoo-feed dev container interactively.

# This does NOT start the overnight build. It just drops you into a shell
# inside the container, with this project folder mounted at /workspace.
#
# Isolation boundary (read this):
#   -v "$PWD":/workspace mounts ONLY the current folder into the container.
#   The container can read and write THIS folder and nothing else on your
#   Mac — not your home directory, not other projects, not system files.
#   Anything the container writes under /workspace appears instantly in this
#   folder on the host, and vice versa, because it is one shared folder, not
#   a copy. Everything outside /workspace inside the container is the
#   image's own throwaway filesystem and is discarded when the container
#   exits (--rm).
